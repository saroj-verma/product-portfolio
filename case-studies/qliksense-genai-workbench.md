# Qlik Sense + GenAI Workbench — Executive Insight Dashboards

**Role:** Product Manager  
**Goal:** Turn raw incident + product KPIs into decision-ready insights

## Problem
Leadership needed timely insights (QoQ/MoM, vendor hot-spots, asset trends) without waiting on analysts to write summaries.

## Approach
- **Models & Apps:** Built Qlik data model combining ServiceNow, Jira actions, and vendor tables; published apps for Ops/PMs/Execs.  
- **GenAI Workbench:** Curated prompts + context windows to generate narrative insights, trend callouts, and anomaly flags.  
- **Governance:** Prompt templates with versioning; human-in-the-loop approvals; audit log of generated insights.

## AI Features
- **Automated Narratives:** “Banking incidents rose **+112% QoQ** (8→17), driven by Green Dot and Cross River Bank.”  
- **Hot-Spot Detection:** Top vendors/services by variance; suggested follow-ups (e.g., file transfer SLA checks).  
- **Weekly Digest:** Scheduled email summaries to stakeholders (embedded charts + text).

## Outcome
- Exec decks reduced from hours to minutes; consistent messaging across org.  
- **Higher signal** in business reviews; actions tracked to closure in Jira.

## My Contribution
End-to-end product ownership: requirements, model fields, prompt engineering, review workflow, and rollout.
