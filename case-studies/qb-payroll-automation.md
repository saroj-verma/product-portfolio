# QuickBooks Payroll — Automation & UX Streamlining

**Role:** Product Manager (Sr. IT Business Analyst)  
**Team:** 25+ cross-functional (Eng, Design, Legal, QA)  
**Timeline:** Multi-release (regulated deadlines)

## Problem
A payroll automation initiative was missing targets: high manual effort, accuracy issues, and rising support tickets.

## Approach
- Mapped E2E flows, prioritized highest-friction steps, and re-scoped MVP.
- Ran usability studies; simplified onboarding and task completion.
- Partnered with HRIS vendors (e.g., BambooHR) to unlock critical integrations.
- Instituted data instrumentation and weekly KPI reviews.

## Outcome
- **–40% manual steps**, **+25% accuracy**, **–20% support tickets**  
- **+22% rollout performance** vs. plan; improved adoption across mid-market.

## Stack
Qlik Sense (dashboards/insights), REST integrations, HRIS APIs, Agile, A/B tests.

## Artifacts (suggested)
Screenshots of flow before/after, KPI charts, PRD snippets (redacted).
